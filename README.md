## Dataset Description
The dataset contains crime statistics spanning from 1950 to 2015 with the following details:

- **Shape**: 66 rows Ã— 21 columns
- **Time Period**: 1950-2015
- **Key Categories**:
  - Year
  - crimes.total
  - crimes.penal.code
  - crimes.person
  - Specific crime types (murder, assault, sexual.offenses, rape, etc.)
  - Property crimes (stealing.general, burglary, vehicle.theft, etc.)
  - Other crimes (fraud, narcotics, drunk.driving)
  - population

The dataset has some missing values (represented as NA) in certain categories:
- house.theft: 15 missing values (22.73%)

## Key Features

### 1. Data Exploration
The project provides a comprehensive data introduction function that reports:
- Dataset dimensions
- Column names and data types
- Missing value analysis
- Sample rows for quick inspection

```python
def data_intro(df):
    # Creates a detailed profile of the dataset
    # Returns profile dictionary and prints formatted summary
    # ...
```

### 2. Data Cleaning
The system includes an automatic data cleaning process that:
- Identifies missing values
- Replaces NAs with column averages
- Reports on changes made
- Provides statistical comparisons before and after cleaning

### 3. LLM-Based Analysis
Leverages Google's Gemini model to:
- Answer inference questions about crime trends
- Provide detailed analyses of data quality issues
- Generate insights based on the available crime statistics

### 4. Crime Data Agent
A comprehensive agent that integrates all functionality:
```python
class CrimeDataAgent:
    def __init__(self, df):
        self.df = df
        self.cleaned_df = None
        self.changes_report = None
    
    def analyze(self, query):
        """Answer inference questions about the data"""
        return analyze_crime_data(query, self.df)
    
    def clean_data(self):
        """Clean data by replacing NA values with column averages"""
        # ...
    
    def compare_stats(self, columns=None):
        """Compare statistics before and after cleaning"""
        # ...
```

## Implementation Details

### Gemini Model Integration
The project uses Google's Gemini 2.0 Flash model for analysis:

```python
model_name = 'gemini-2.0-flash'

llm_model = ChatGoogleGenerativeAI(
    model=model_name,
    google_api_key=api_key,
    temperature=0.0,
    convert_system_message_to_human=True
)
```

### Data Analysis Functions
The system implements specialized functions for crime data analysis:

```python
def analyze_crime_data(query, df):
    """Use LLM to analyze crime data and answer inference questions"""
    
    # Create a summary of the data for context
    data_summary = f"""
    This dataset contains crime statistics from {df['Year'].min()} to {df['Year'].max()}.
    It includes {df.shape[1]} columns with various crime categories and population data.
    Total records: {df.shape[0]}
    
    # ...additional summary details...
    """
    
    inference_template = """
    You are a data analyst specialized in crime statistics. Based on the provided dataset information, 
    answer the following query with detailed analysis.
    
    Dataset Summary:
    {data_summary}
    
    User Query: {query}
    
    # ...template continues...
    """
```

### Data Cleaning Process
The NA replacement function handles missing values appropriately:

```python
def replace_na_with_average(df):
    """Replace NA values in each column with the column average"""
    
    # Create a copy of the dataframe to avoid modifying the original
    cleaned_df = df.copy()
    
    # Track what changes were made
    changes_report = {}
    
    # Process each column
    for column in cleaned_df.columns:
        # Check if column has NA values and is numeric
        if cleaned_df[column].isna().any() and np.issubdtype(cleaned_df[column].dtype, np.number):
            # Calculate average excluding NA values
            avg_value = cleaned_df[column].mean()
            # Count NA values
            na_count = cleaned_df[column].isna().sum()
            # Replace NA with average
            cleaned_df[column].fillna(avg_value, inplace=True)
            # Record the change
            changes_report[column] = {
                "na_count": int(na_count),
                "replacement_value": float(avg_value),
                "percentage_affected": float(na_count / len(cleaned_df) * 100)
            }
    
    return cleaned_df, changes_report
```

## Usage Examples

### 1. Initializing the Agent
```python
# Load the dataset
df = pd.read_csv('reported.csv')

# Initialize the agent
crime_agent = CrimeDataAgent(df)
```

### 2. Analyzing Crime Trends
```python
# Ask an inference question about violent crime trends
inference_result = crime_agent.analyze("What are the trends in violent crimes over time?")
print("INFERENCE ANALYSIS:")
print(inference_result)
```

Example output shows a comprehensive analysis of violent crime trends, including:
- Analysis of crimes.person, murder, assault, and rape over time
- Relationship to population changes
- Correlation analysis between crime types
- Limitations of the dataset and suggestions for deeper analysis

### 3. Cleaning the Data
```python
# Clean the data by replacing NA values with averages
changes = crime_agent.clean_data()
print("\nCLEANING REPORT:")
for col, details in changes.items():
    print(f"- {col}: Replaced {details['na_count']} NA values with {details['replacement_value']:.2f}")
```

Sample cleaning report:
```
CLEANING REPORT:
- house.theft: Replaced 15 NA values with 210.53
- vehicle.theft: Replaced 7 NA values with 466.29
- out.of.vehicle.theft: Replaced 15 NA values with 1192.57
- shop.theft: Replaced 15 NA values with 540.29
- narcotics: Replaced 4 NA values with 386.63
```

### 4. Comparing Statistics Before and After Cleaning
```python
# Compare statistics before and after cleaning
stats_comparison = crime_agent.compare_stats()
print("\nSTATISTICS COMPARISON:")
for col, stats in stats_comparison.items():
    print(f"- {col}:")
    print(f"  Before: mean={stats['original_mean']:.2f}, std={stats['original_std']:.2f}")
    print(f"  After:  mean={stats['cleaned_mean']:.2f}, std={stats['cleaned_std']:.2f}")
```

Sample comparison output:
```
STATISTICS COMPARISON:
- house.theft:
  Before: mean=210.53, std=48.68
  After:  mean=210.53, std=42.69
- vehicle.theft:
  Before: mean=466.29, std=193.70
  After:  mean=466.29, std=182.97
- out.of.vehicle.theft:
  Before: mean=1192.57, std=432.54
  After:  mean=1192.57, std=379.36
- shop.theft:
  Before: mean=540.29, std=185.30
  After:  mean=540.29, std=162.52
- narcotics:
  Before: mean=386.63, std=307.13
  After:  mean=386.63, std=297.53
```

## Data Cleaning
The analysis of data quality issues identified several potential areas for improvement:

1. **Missing Values**: Several fields have "NA" values that need proper handling
2. **Data Type Issues**: Ensuring consistent numeric types after handling missing values
3. **Consistency/Validity**: Verifying that crime category sums align with total crimes
4. **Column Naming**: Considering renaming columns to use underscores instead of periods

The implemented solution handles these issues by:
- Replacing NA values with column means for numeric fields
- Maintaining data type consistency
- Providing before/after statistical comparisons
- Documenting all changes made during cleaning

## Limitations
1. The system currently only implements mean imputation for missing values
2. no reasearch, can get API for the browser
3. prompt matters, i wrote 2 prommpt chains, while they are doing differnt things, procces differs in the same step, both of them had to do infernce step
